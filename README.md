## Project Overview
For my first project, I decided to do a clothing store (knock off of Gucci: Fucci), just because lately I have gotten super into fashion. I wanted to have a visually aesthetic page with colors and layouts that are easy on the eye, and I also wanted to make a page that is super easy to navigate using the navbar.
## Details/Functionality
The page is super easy to navigate through, just simply click any of the tabs on the navbar to get to a desired page, or you can also find the men and women's sections if you scroll down on the home page. Need to get in touch with us? Simply click the "Contact Us" tab in the navbar, and you will be redirrected to a page where you can send us an email! Don't want to miss out on all the latest drops/news? Great! Simply click the social-media icons on the bottom of the page, and you will be redirrected to our social-media pages!
## Technologies Used
